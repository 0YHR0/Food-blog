IF you want to deploy this project to your computer:
1.Please check all the PHP files, make sure the username and password to the MYSQL is correct
2.Please check all the ajax request in the javascript, make sure the path of the request is correct and set the port number as your Apache port.
3.Because the project is already deployed on my cloud server. I use the ip address of my server. But the comment in the program has already written for the localhost
all you need is open these comments and comment the origin code of open http request.
4. You should import the initial.sql to your mysql to create the databese needed automatically

!!! Make sure you open the extension of msqli in the php!!!
!!!Make sure your mysql version is higher than 8.0, otherwise you can't import the script!!!
!!!Make sure you computer is connected to the Internet, because some resources are referenced to the Internet!!!
